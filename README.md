## Repository Structure
- `pipeline.py`: The main executable script that processes data and generates the SQLite database.
- `LatLngExtractor.py`: Script to extract latitude and longitude data for the analysis.
- `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the exploratory data analysis.
- `report.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with a comprehensive report of the findings.
- `nuremberg_stops_immoscout.sqlite`: The SQLite database generated by `pipeline.py`.
- `driver.sh`: Shell script to run the pipeline and lat/lng extraction process.
- `requirements.txt`: File containing all the dependencies to be installed.
- Visualizations:
  - `frequency_map.html`: Interactive map showing the frequency of apartment listings by town.
  - `rental_map.html`: Interactive map indicating rental prices across Nuremberg.
  - `listing_pie.png`: Pie chart visualization of apartment listing frequencies.
  - `listing_bar.png`: Bar chart visualization of apartment listing frequencies.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gmMustafa/NurembergTransitRentAnalysis
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
3. Install dependencies:
