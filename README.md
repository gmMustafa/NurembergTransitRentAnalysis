# NurembergTransitRentAnalysis

Exploring the correlation between public transport stops and rental prices in Nuremberg to provide insights for optimizing transportation networks and housing accessibility. Utilizes datasets on Nuremberg Stops and Immoscout24 listings, employing data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Repository Structure
- `pipeline.py`: The main executable script that processes data and generates the SQLite database.
- `LatLngExtractor.py`: Script to extract latitude and longitude data for the analysis.
- `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the exploratory data analysis.
- `report.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with a comprehensive report of the findings.
- `nuremberg_stops_immoscout.sqlite`: The SQLite database generated by `pipeline.py`.
- `driver.sh`: Shell script to run the pipeline and lat/lng extraction process.
- `requirements.txt`: File containing all the dependencies to be installed.
- Visualizations:
  - `frequency_map.html`: Interactive map showing the frequency of apartment listings by town.
  - `rental_map.html`: Interactive map indicating rental prices across Nuremberg.
  - `listing_pie.png`: Pie chart visualization of apartment listing frequencies.
  - `listing_bar.png`: Bar chart visualization of apartment listing frequencies.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gmMustafa/NurembergTransitRentAnalysis
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the data pipeline:
   ```
   python pipeline.py
   ```
   This will generate the `nuremberg_stops_immoscout.sqlite` database.
5. To perform the exploratory data analysis, run the `LatLngExtractor.py` script first:
   ```
   python LatLngExtractor.py
   ```
6. Open and review the `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook for preliminary analysis.
7. For a detailed analysis, open and review the `report.ipynb` notebook.

## Visualization and Analysis
The repository includes interactive maps (`frequency_map.html` and `rental_map.html`) that provide a visual representation of the dataset's geographical information. Additionally, the pie and bar chart images (`listing_pie.png` and `listing_bar.png`) offer a clear distribution of apartments based on their location in Nuremberg.

For a complete walkthrough of the analysis process and findings, refer to the Jupyter notebooks included in the repository.
